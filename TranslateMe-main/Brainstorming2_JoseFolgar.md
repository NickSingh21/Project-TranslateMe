# Mobile App Dev - App Brainstorming
## App Idea Thunderdome

Jose Folgar:

**1. Health Journal**
* The app is for keeping track of your health and workouts you do, and possibly sharing your progress with friends
* The app is for anyone who works out and has friends
* We want to have a place to make it more accessible and simple for people to share their progress and motivate each other
* Figuring out how to have friends and sharing only with specific people might be a bit difficult
      
**2. Movie/TV Show Recommender**
* This app would help you decide what TV Show or movie to watch on a night when you can't decide
* The app is for undecisive people or for people who want to try something new and spontaneous
* I, myself, have a difficult time deciding what shows to watch. This would help people find a show they want to watch faster.
* Figuring out how many options and filters we want to have may take some time since there are so many possibilities.
