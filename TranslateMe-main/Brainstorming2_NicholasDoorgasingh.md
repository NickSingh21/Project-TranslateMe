# Mobile App Dev - App Brainstorming
## App Idea Thunderdome

Nicholas Doorgasingh:

**1. Movie APP**
* The app is for keeping up to date with recent movies
* The app is for anyone who loves going out and watching movies
* We want to have a place to make it more accessible 
* Figuring out how to have friends share and build the app
      
**2. Health and Recovery**
* This app would help you decide what what exercise to do for the day
* The app is for undecisive people or for people who want to try something new 
*  This would help people find a workout that works for them
* Figuring out how many options and filters needed to fufill.
